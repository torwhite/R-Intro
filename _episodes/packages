teaching: Package - collection of R functions, data and compiled code
Library - The location where the packages are stored
If there is a particular functionality that you require, you can download the package from the appropriate site, and it will be stored in your library. 
To use the package, use the command library() to load the package in the current R session. Then just call the appropriate package functions install.packages("package_name") 
– Install the package from CRAN repository install.packages( c("package_1", “"package_2", "package_3") )
– Install multiple packages library("package_name") – Load the package in current R session
