## About the Data Used in this Workshop:

The datasets used in this workshop are commosn "built-in" datasets in R, one  called cars and another called colleges. This means that the datasets are already pre-loaded in R and do not need to be imported from another source (csv, excel etc.). In the workshop, you will learn how to interact with these datasets.
